# Timeline

## Project Description  
Timeline is a smart contract project that allows a user (owner) to maintain a chronological list of events with descriptions and timestamps on the blockchain. It serves as a decentralized ledger to track milestones or important moments immutably.

## Project Vision  
To create a simple, transparent, and tamper-proof timeline of events accessible on-chain, enabling verifiable historical records for personal or organizational use.

## Key Features  
- Only owner can add events to the timeline  
- Events stored with timestamp and description  
- Readable event count and individual event details  
- Immutable and transparent event history on blockchain

## Future Scope  
- Multi-user access with permissions  
- Event editing or tagging  
- Integration with off-chain metadata or IPFS  
- Frontend UI for easier timeline visualization  
- Event notifications and reminders
